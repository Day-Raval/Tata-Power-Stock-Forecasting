# Tata-Power-Stock-Forecasting

The project aims at creating visualizations depicting each important aspect of stock analysis. 
The story and dashboard are included in order to simplify the understanding of the purpose.
First, the past analysis of all prices- starting, closing, and adjacent closing is done. Afterwards, 
the data is used to forecast the stock prices for the upcoming period of time. Staying informed about market news, understanding risk management strategies, and 
employing various analytical tools and techniques can help improve the accuracy of stock price 
analysis. This is a general idea about the stock prices over the years.
